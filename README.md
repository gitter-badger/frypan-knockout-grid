### A lightweight and powerful data grid for Knockout

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nathanboktae/frypan-knockout-grid.png)](http://travis-ci.org/nathanboktae/frypan-knockout-grid)

[![SauceLabs Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/frypan-knockout-grid.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/frypan-knockout-grid)

### Features

- Column sorting
- Column filtering
- Searching
- Automatic Virtualization if needed
- Custom column templates, with built-in one for link rendering
- Asyncrounous (Remote) data sources
- Persists and load settings to local storage
- Dynamic column discovery - an array of objects (or async data function) is all you need to get started 
- No event soup - everything is wrapped in computed observables. Everything just works when your data and options change
